# Code To Software Documentation with Flow Diagram Generator

# Introduction
This project is an implementation of code to software documentation using the Hugging Face Transformers library to load the pre-trained model and generate software documentation for input code. The project includes a simple web interface that allows users to input code and generate software documentation using the model.

# Usage
The project is free to use without any cost. You can use it for your personal use or for your projects. You can also modify the code and use it for commercial purposes. You can also contribute to the project by adding new features or fixing bugs.

No API key is required to use this project. You can simply clone the repository and run the project on your local machine.

## We created this project to help developers generate software documentation from code. The project uses the Hugging Face Transformers library to load the pre-trained model and generate software documentation for input code. The project includes a simple web interface that allows users to input code and generate software documentation using the model.
## it is not so accurate but it can help you to generate a basic documentation for your code.
## we are continuously working on this project to make it more accurate and useful.

## you can use sample : SampleCodeFIle folder to test the project.
